      <h2>1. QstudioLab School</h2>
      <p>
        We are currently accepting Kindergarten -Third Grade Students for the current 2017-2018 school year.
        We are expanding by 1-2 grade each new academic year.
      </p>
      <p>
        At our school, students exercise their head, heart and body.  We recognize that children are innately curious and eager learners.  All students are engaged in the learning process through project based methods and learning lab explorations.
        Core academic skills are imbedded in all activities.  Students have the opportunity for real life applications as we expand our classroom into our community during our weekly adventure and community service days.

      <h2>2. PreQ  DAYCARE</h2>
      <p>Full or part time options for 2-3 year olds</p>
      <p>Inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach, an emergent curriculum is developed by observing each child individually
        as well as childrenâ€™s work in groups and developing activities and classroom areas based on the explorations,
        interests and developmental needs of each child and group of children.</p>
      <p>We work to help children build strong relationships while expressing themselves and their ideas.
        Our belief is that children learn best through hands-on experiences where they can get their hands messy in the
        process!</p>
      <p>Also available are MORNING  INFANT/TODDLER CLASSES in which  the caregiver or mom and child interact together
        a guide, playing in a variety of experiential mediums, such as water, sand, textures, and clay.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <h2>3. AFTERSCHOOL AT THE Q</h2>
